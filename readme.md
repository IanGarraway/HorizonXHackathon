# Modello Pharus Horizon X Hackathon

## The Challenge

### The Problem

- What Large Language Models (LLMs) for regulated industries (banking, pharma, etc) are out there?
- which ones should be looked into? which ones should be avoided?

for the people who encounter these problems, what resources are there to help them over come them?

### The Deliverables

- Create a system of analysis for qualitatively analysing the LLMS

#### 2. LLM Catalog

- A website displaying a list of the different LLMs
- Individual pages going into a dedicated more detailed page
- Clean and professional layout, minimalist design, consistent look
- Ample white space
